<h3>Continuations</h3>

<p><em>You must complete this assignment with a new partner. This must
  be your second distinct partner for the course. You and your partner
  must each understand the answers to both problems, so don't just do
  one each.</em></p>
 
<hr>

<h3>Problem 1</h3>

<p>Any program that consumes some amount of stack, when converted to CPS and
run, suddenly consumes no stack space at all. Why?</p>

<p>Does this mean that every program should be converted to CPS? Why or
why not?</p>

<hr>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>

<p> CPS the following Scheme function.  You don't need to CPS
primitives such as <code>empty?</code>, <code>first</code>,
<code>rest</code>, <code>cons</code>, <code>cons?</code> and
<code>&lt;</code>.  You may also assume that the function argument to both
of the functions is in CPS.  Name the result <code>filter/k</code> as shown
below.</p>

<pre>;; filter: (x -&gt; bool) (listof x) -&gt; (listof x)
(define (filter f l)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) empty]
    [else (cond
            [(f (first l)) (cons (first l)
                                 (filter f (rest l)))]
            [else (filter f (rest l))])]))

;; filter/k: (x receiver -&gt; doesn't return) (listof x) receiver -&gt; doesn't return
(define (filter/k f l k)
  'fill-me-in)
</pre>

<p> Now change the following expressions to use <code>filter/k</code>. </p>

<pre>(define (less-than-three x)
   (&lt; x 3))
(filter less-than-three
        (cons 1 (cons 4 empty))) ;; this evaluates to (list 1)

</pre> <br>

<hr>

<h3>Problem 3</h3>

<p>The Java security model uses a primitive called <em>stack
inspection</em>.  Let us implement a simple version of this.  Assume
the language had two new primitives:
</p>

<pre>&lt;E&gt; ::= ...
    | {bless &lt;E&gt;}
    | {check}
</pre>

<p>The <code>bless</code> primitive creates a blessed stack frame for
the duration of evaluating its sub-expression.  The <code>check</code>
primitive traverses the run-time stack; if it finds a blessed frame it
evaluates to <code>0</code> (so you can, for instance, use it inside
sums without affecting the outcome), otherwise it terminates the
program's execution.
</p>

<p>
Extend the CPSed interpreter presented in the text in Figure 20.2
with these two new language constructs.  For your convenience, here is a file
to start with: <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2008/Assignments/support/stackinspect.ss">stackinspect.ss</a>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: Java lacks tail-call optimization ostensibly
because this hurts the ability to implement stack inspection.  In
fact, <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/cf-toplas04.pdf">this 
claim is entirely false</a>.  But we're stuck with the result of this
decision, making the JVM a poor target for other language compilers.
Unfortunately, .NET has also adopted this mistake, as the paper explains.

<p>Turn in four files:

</p><ol>
  
  <li><code>whynostack.txt</code>, which contains your solution to
  Problem 1.</li>

  <li><code>filterk.ss</code>, which contains your solution to
  Problem 2.</li>

  <li><code>stackinspect.ss</code>, which contains your solution to
  Problem 3.</li>

  <li>A README file containing the names of the members of your
