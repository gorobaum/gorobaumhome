<p>
<em>You must do this assignment solo.  We know that some of you are
not yet comfortable with Scheme; for that reason, we will weight this
assignment very, very low in the overall score.  Doing poorly on it
will not at all damage your course grade.  But, you should exploit
this opportunity to become familiar with the style of programming you
will do in the rest of the semester.</em></p>


<h3>Rudimentary Interpreter</h3>

<ol>

  <li>Write a parser and interpreter for the WAE language we discussed
  in class. <strong>The textbook can be of great assistance in this part
    of the assignment;</strong> it provides an abstract syntax datatype
  and the beginnings of a parser and an interpreter.</li>

  <li>Once you've <strong>written and tested</strong> the parser and
  interpreter for WAE, extend it with the features described below.</li>

</ol>

<p>In each part of the assignment, implement the function
<code>parse</code>, which consumes an expression in the language's
concrete syntax and returns the abstract syntax representation of that
expression. <code>parse</code> must accept only expressions in the
syntax of the language.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>parse</code>, you must implement the function
<code>interp</code>, which consumes an abstract syntax expression (as
returned by the <code>parse</code> function) and returns a Scheme
number.

</p><p><strong>You must include a contract for every function that you write
  and include test cases that amply exercise all of the code you've
  written.</strong> We will not give <strong>any</strong> credit to
untested functionality, even if it is correct! (Note that DrScheme will
tell you if any of your code is untested.) Refer to the <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2008/Syllabus/">syllabus</a> for style requirements.</p>

<h3>Features to Implement</h3>

<dl>

<dt>WAE</dt>

<dd><p>The WAE language has numbers, two arithmetic operators
(<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>), identifiers and <code>with</code>
expressions.  Of course, to handle identifiers and <code>with</code>
expressions you'll have to implement substitution.</p></dd>

<dt>Binary arithmetic operators</dt>

<dd><p>In place of having separate rules for <code>+</code> and
<code>-</code>, define a single syntactic rule for all binary arithmetic
operators.  Parse these into a <code>binop</code> datatype variant.
Define a table that maps operator names (symbols) to actual functions
(Scheme procedures) that perform the corresponding operation.  Having a
single rule like this, accompanied by a table, makes your language
easier to extend: once you have modified your parser and interpreter
once to support binary operators, you won't need to touch either one to
add any number of new ones.  To demonstrate this, define multiplication
and division (using <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> to represent them
in the language's concrete syntax).  </p></dd>

<dt>Multi-armed <code>with</code> </dt>

<dd><p>Each identifier bound by
the <code>with</code> expression is bound only in its body.  There will
be zero or more identifiers bound by each <code>with</code> expression.
If there are multiple bindings of the same identifier in a single
<code>with</code> expression's bindings list, your interpreter should 
halt with an error message.  An example:</p>

<pre>{with {{x 2}
       {y 3}}
  {with {{z {+ x y}}}
    {+ x z}}}
</pre>

<p>will evaluate to <code>7</code>, while</p>

<pre>{with {{x 2}
       {x 3}}
	{+ x 2}}
</pre>

<p>will halt with an error message.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The syntax of the language you should implement can be captured with
the following grammar:</p>

<pre>&lt;WAE&gt; ::= &lt;num&gt;
    | {+ &lt;WAE&gt; &lt;WAE&gt;}
    | {- &lt;WAE&gt; &lt;WAE&gt;}
    | {* &lt;WAE&gt; &lt;WAE&gt;}
    | {/ &lt;WAE&gt; &lt;WAE&gt;}
    | {with {{&lt;id&gt; &lt;WAE&gt;} ...} &lt;WAE&gt;}
    | &lt;id&gt;
where an &lt;id&gt; is not +, -, *, /, or with.
</pre>

<p>In this grammar, the ellipsis (<code>...</code>) means that the previous
non-terminal is present zero or more times.</p>

<p>If a <code>with</code> expression has duplicate identifiers, we
consider it a syntax error. Therefore, such errors must be detected in
<code>parse</code>. For example, parsing the following expression must
signal an error:

</p><pre>{with {{x 10} {x 20}} 50}
</pre>

<h3>Scheme's <code>(match ...)</code> Syntax</h3> If you're pretty comfortable with Scheme, or are
feeling particularly adventurous, check out the <code>(match ...)</code> syntax
in the <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1730/2008/Manual/reference/match.html">
	PLT Scheme Docs</a>.  It could make your parser prettier and easier to write.

<p>Note that this a <b>power user feature</b> and is <b>not required</b>.  If
you find yourself getting frustrated using the <code>cond/case</code> syntax to
parse the input, take a look.  If you're still shaky on Scheme in general, skip
it for now.

</p><h3>Testing Your Code</h3>

<p>Your parser and interpreter must detect errors and explicitly signal them by
calling <code>(error ...)</code>.  We will consider an error raised internally
by Scheme to be a bug in your code.</p>

<p>For example, Scheme signals a "divide by zero" error if you attempt
to evaluate <code>(/ 1 0)</code>.  Since we use Scheme's division
function to implement division in this assignment, you may be tempted to
leave it to Scheme to signal division by zero errors for you.  However,
you must signal the error yourself by explicitly testing for division by
zero before calling Scheme's division procedure.</p>

If you are not sure if an error raised by your program constitutes a
bug, search the DrScheme Help for <code>test/exn</code>.
<code>test/exn</code> tests for errors, but only succeeds on errors that
you explicitly signal.

<h3>Support Code</h3>

<p>
Use the "PLAI Scheme" language.  Your code <strong>must</strong>
adhere to the following template, without any changes:
</p>

<pre>(define-type Binding
  [binding (name symbol?) (named-expr WAE?)])

(define-type WAE
  [num (n number?)]
  [binop (op procedure?) (lhs WAE?) (rhs WAE?)]
  [with (lob (listof Binding?)) (body WAE?)]
  [id (name symbol?)])

;; parse : s-exp -&gt; WAE
;; Consumes an s-expression and generates the corresponding WAE
(define (parse sexp)
  ...)

;; interp : WAE -&gt; number
;; Consumes a WAE representation of an expression and computes
;;   the corresponding numerical result
(define (interp expr)
  ...)
</pre>

<h3>Handin</h3>

<p>Turn in a single file called <code>rinterp.ss</code>, that contains all of
the code needed to run your parser and interpreter.</p>
