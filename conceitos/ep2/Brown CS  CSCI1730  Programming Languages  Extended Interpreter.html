<em>You must do this assignment solo.  We know that some of you are
not yet comfortable with Scheme; for that reason, we will weight this
assignment very, very low in the overall score.  Doing poorly on it
will not at all damage your course grade.  But, you should exploit
this opportunity to become familiar with the style of programming you
will do in the rest of the semester.</em></p>

<h3>Extended Interpreter</h3>

<ol>

  <li>Write a parser and interpreter for the CFWAE language we've
  discussed in class, extended with the language features described
  below.  Your interpreter should have eager application semantics and
  use deferred substitution.</li> <br>

  <li>After completing the first part of the assignment, copy the
  resulting interpreter and modify it so that it has lazy application
  semantics. (We strongly recommend that you not attempt this part of
  the assignment until you've gotten the first interpreter done,
  thoroughly tested, and debugged!)  <i>Ensure you don't miss the change
    you must make to the <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2008/Assignments/02-xinterp.html#lazyvalue">type definitions</a> for
    this part.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>In each part of the assignment, implement the function
<code>parse</code>, which consumes an expression in the language's
concrete syntax and returns the abstract syntax representation of that
expression. <code>parse</code> must accept only expressions in the
syntax of the language.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>parse</code>, you must implement the function
<code>interp</code>, which consumes an abstract syntax expression (as
returned by the <code>parse</code> function) and returns a
<code>CFWAE-Value</code>.

</p><p><strong>You must include a contract for every function that you write
  and include test cases that amply exercise all of the code you've
  written.</strong> We will not give <strong>any</strong> credit to
untested functionality, even if it is correct! (Note that DrScheme will
tell you if any of your code is untested.) Refer to the <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2008/Syllabus/">syllabus</a> for style requirements.</p>

<h3>Features to Implement</h3>

<dl>

<dt>CFWAE</dt>

<dd><p>As the name suggests, your language should support conditionals,
functions, <code>with</code>, and arithmetic expressions.</p></dd>

<dt>Conditionals</dt>

<dd>
<p>To save the trouble of having to add boolean values and operators over them,
create the construct <code>if0</code> using the syntax described by the EBNF below.
Note that <code>if0</code> has three branches:</p>

<ul>
<li>A test expression</li>

<li>A "then" expression, which evaluates if the test expression
evaluates to zero</li>

<li>An "else" expression, which evaluates for any other number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Evaluation should signal an error for non-numeric test values.</p></dd>


<!--
<dt>Multi-armed <code>rec</code></dt>

<dd>
Using the datatype definition of environments, implement a multi-armed
<code>rec</code> construct that cyclically binds zero or more identifiers. If
there are multiple bindings of the same identifier in a single <code>rec</code>
expression's list of bindings, your interpreter should halt with an error
message. Each named expression can access all the identifiers bound by the
<code>rec</code>. All the named expressions must syntactically be functions.
</dd>
-->

<dt>Multi-argument <code>fun</code></dt>

<dd><p>Extend the <code>fun</code> language feature described in lecture so
that functions can accept a list of zero or more arguments instead of
just one.  All arguments to the function must evaluate with the 
<i>same deferred substitutions</i>.  An example of a multi-argument fun:</p>

<pre>{{fun {x y} {* x y}} 2 3}
</pre>

<p>This evaluates to 6.</p>

<p>As you did for multi-armed <code>with</code>, you must ensure that the
arguments to a function have distinct names.</p>

</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The syntax of the language you should implement can be captured with
the following grammar:</p>

<pre>&lt;CFWAE&gt; ::= &lt;num&gt;
    | {+ &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {- &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {* &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {/ &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | &lt;id&gt;
    | {if0 &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {with {{&lt;id&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt;} ...} &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {fun {&lt;id&gt; ...} &lt;CFWAE&gt;}
    | {&lt;CFWAE&gt; &lt;CFWAE&gt; ...}
where an id is not +, -, *, /, with, if0 or fun.
</pre>

<p>In this grammar, the ellipsis (<code>...</code>) means that the previous
non-terminal is present zero or more times.</p>

<p>If a <code>fun</code> or a <code>with</code> expression has duplicate
identifiers, we consider it a syntax error. Therefore, such errors must be
detected in <code>parse</code>. For example, parsing the following
expressions must signal errors:

</p><pre>{with {{x 10} {x 20}} 50}

{fun {x x} 10}
</pre>

<h3>Scheme's <code>(match ...)</code> Syntax</h3> If you're feeling better with
Scheme and think your <code>rinterp</code> parser is disgusting, now might be
the time to take a look at Scheme's <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1730/2008/Manual/reference/match.html">
	<code>(match ...)</code> syntax</a>.  But it is still (and always will be)
<b>not required</b>.

<h3>Testing Your Code</h3>

<p>Your parser and interpreter must detect errors and explicitly signal
them by calling <code>(error ...)</code>.  We will consider an error
raised internally by Scheme to be a bug in your code.</p>

<p>For example, Scheme signals a "divide by zero" error if you attempt
to evaluate <code>(/ 1 0)</code>.  Since we use Scheme's division
function to implement division in this assignment, you may be tempted to
leave it to Scheme to signal division by zero errors for you.  However,
you must signal the error yourself by explicitly testing for division by
zero before calling Scheme's division procedure.</p>

If you are not sure if an error raised by your program constitutes a
bug, search the DrScheme Help for <code>test/exn</code>.
<code>test/exn</code> tests for errors, but only succeeds on errors that
you explicitly signal.

<h3>Support Code</h3>

<p>
Use the "PLAI Scheme" language.  Your code <strong>must</strong>
adhere to the following template, without any changes:
</p>

<pre>(define-type Binding
  [binding (name symbol?) (named-expr CFWAE?)])

(define-type CFWAE
  [num (n number?)]
  [binop (op procedure?) (lhs CFWAE?) (rhs CFWAE?)]
  [with (lob (listof Binding?)) (body CFWAE?)]
  [id (name symbol?)]
  [if0 (c CFWAE?) (t CFWAE?) (e CFWAE?)]
  [fun (args (listof symbol?)) (body CFWAE?)]
  [app (f CFWAE?) (args (listof CFWAE?))])

(define-type Env
  [mtEnv]
  [anEnv (name symbol?) (value CFWAE-Value?) (env Env?)])

(define-type CFWAE-Value
  [numV (n number?)]
  [closureV (params (listof symbol?))
            (body CFWAE?)
            (env Env?)])

;; parse : expression -&gt; CFWAE
;; This procedure parses an expression into a CFWAE
(define (parse sexp)
  ...)

;; interp : CFWAE -&gt; CFWAE-Value
;; This procedure interprets the given CFWAE and produces a result
;; in the form of a CFWAE-Value (either a closureV or a numV)
(define (interp expr)
  ...)
</pre>

<p><a name="lazyvalue"></a>For the second part of the assignment (lazy
application), you will need to add an <code>exprV</code> variant to
<code>CFWAE-Value</code>.  That is, <code>CFWAE-Value</code> for
<code>xinterp-lazy.ss</code> should read:</p>

<pre>(define-type CFWAE-Value
  [numV (n number?)]
  [closureV (params (listof symbol?))
            (body CFWAE?)
            (env Env?)]
  [exprV (expr CFWAE?) (env Env?)]))
</pre>

<p>That said, note that <code>interp</code> should never return an
<code>exprV</code>. The top-level is always a strictness point.</p>

<h3>Handin</h3>

<p>Turn in two files where each contains all of the code needed to run
your parser and interpreter:

</p><ol>
  
  <li><code>xinterp.ss</code>, which uses eager evaluation.</li>

  <li><code>xinterp-lazy.ss</code>, which uses lazy evaluation.</li>

</ol>

<p></p>
