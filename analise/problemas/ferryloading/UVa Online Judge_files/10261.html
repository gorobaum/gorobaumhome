Before bridges were common, ferries were used to transport cars across
rivers.  River ferries, unlike their larger cousins, run on a guide
line and are powered by the river's current.  Two lanes of cars drive
onto the ferry from one end, the ferry crosses the river, and the
cars exit from the other end of the ferry.
<p>
The cars waiting to board the
ferry form a single queue, and the operator directs each car in turn
to drive onto the port (left) or starboard (right) lane of the ferry
so as to balance the load.
Each car in the queue has a different length, which the
operator estimates by inspecting the queue.  Based on this inspection,
the operator decides which side of the ferry each car should board,
and boards as many cars as possible from the queue, subject to the
length limit of the ferry.
Your job is to write a program that will
tell the operator which car to load on which side so as
to maximize the number of cars loaded.
</p><h3>The Input</h3>
<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating 
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. 
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between 
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>
</p><p>


The first line of input contains a single integer between 1 and 100:
the length of the ferry (in metres).
For each car in the queue there is an additional line of input specifying
the length of the car (in cm, an integer between 100 and 10000 inclusive).  
A final line of input contains the integer 0.
The cars must be loaded in order, subject to the constraint that
the total length of cars on either side does not exceed the length
of the ferry.
Subject to this constraint as many cars should be loaded as possible,
starting with the first car in the queue and loading cars in order
until no more can be loaded.
</p><h3>
The Output
</h3>
<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. 
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>
</p><p>

The first line of outuput should give the number of cars that
can be loaded onto the ferry.
For each car that can be loaded onto the ferry, in the order the
cars appear in the input, output a line containing "port" if the
car is to be directed to the port side and "starboard" if the
car is to be directed to the starboard side.  If several arrangements
of the cars meet the criteria above, any one will do.
